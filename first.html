            <p style="font-size:25px; color:DarkBlue; ">Odia Cuisine is the cuisine of the state of Odisha.
                 It has developed over time with local culture and agriculture and hence 
                 has its distinct items and practices. Odisha borders both north Indian 
                 states and south Indian states and consequently is similar to the cuisines 
                 of South and North India.
                Enduri Pitha, a typical Odia sweet Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, 
                Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy while nonetheless remaining flavourful.
                 Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the 
                 cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples. In old times 
                 food was traditionally served on banana leaves or disposable plates made of sal leaves              
                Odia cooks, particularly from the Puri region, were much sought after due to their 
                ability to cook food in accordance with Hindu scriptures. During the 19th century, 
                many Odia cooks were employed in Bengal and they took many Odia dishes with them.
                This period also saw a heavy demand for Brahmin cooks, leading many Odia cooks to fake 
                their castes.
                Yoghurt is used in dishes. Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese).</p>
