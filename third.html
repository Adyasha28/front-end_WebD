                  Manda pitha or the rice flour dumpling looks like a twin sister of rasgulla from outside 
                  but has a coconut stuffing inside. It also resembles South India’s Kozhakkattai and
                  Maharashtra’s Modak. It is usually prepared during monsoons and post-monsoons for festivals 
                  like Gamha Purnima, Manabasa Gurubara or Kumar Purnima.</i></p></td>

                    This old-town crunchy caramelized delicacy is whipped up with jaggery, coconut, khai and 
                    cardamoms. Korakhai too is served as a prasad to many deities. These are available in packets 
                    and since they are dry, many tourists prefer to carry them on their way back home. A shop named
                    Baya Baba Kora Khai in Bhubaneshwar is highly reputed for selling this dry sweet.</i></p></td>

                   Khaja, or fritter dunked in sugar syrup, is the crispiest and most delicious coastal sweet. 
                   It is one of the items of Chaapan Bhog of Puri’s Jagannath temple. The Chappan Bhog consists
                   of 56 types of food served as prasad. Puri receives a large number of Bengali tourists every
                   year and Khaja is in high demand among them.</i></p></td>

                     Looking at this dish might remind you of Upma. To make this dish, sundried red lentil
                     dumplings ( masoor dal badi) are fried in low flame. The fried dumplings are crushed and 
                     blended, along with chopped onions, garlic, cloves and green chili. A pinch of salt is added
                      to this mixture and the ready Badi Chura is served with plain rice or Pakhala.</i></p></td>

                   <p style="font-size:20px ;color:darkred; text-align:justify"><i>
                      This is a soothing summer dish of Odisha made from rice soaked in water overnight. In the 
                      morning, the water is strained out and fresh water is added to the rice. The damp rice is 
                      sauteed with salt, tempered spices, mint or basil leaves and then curd is added to it. The
                      dish is often served with Badi Chura. Locals say that Pakhala aids in bringing sound sleep.</i></p></td>
